Hi, I'm a freelance graphic UX/UI interaction product designer, living and working in Dublin.

I’m at my best when I’m creating meaningful, lasting design that solves real problems. I’m also a complete nerd about coffee (yes, I weigh it everytime) and, when I’m not designing, you’ll usually find me somewhere in the Wicklow mountains on a mountain bike.

Previously I was lead designer on the Creative Technology team at Radical where I worked on a wide range of digital projects for clients including Toyota, Samsung, Mars, An Post and the Road Safety Authority of Ireland.

While I was at Radical we picked up a silver ICAD bell for sticking a giant ginger moustache on the front of our office for Movember. I know, really, but it was huge, and it was plugged into the internet. Watch the case study video here.

I’m available for interesting projects, collaborations and agency work on a freelance or contract basis. I’m particularly keen to hear from you if you are making a product.

If it sounds like we might get along, and I’d be a good fit for your project, I’d love to hear from you.
