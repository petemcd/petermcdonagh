I"Æ<p>Iâ€™m a freelance product designer from Ireland. I partner and collaborate with people, organisations and companies to help them plan, design and ship great products that are simple, beautiful and easy to use.</p>

<p>At the moment, Iâ€™m working with <a href="https://interplayapp.com">Interplay</a> to help them build a new design tool which lets designers use code components from their design system to design visually in the browser. Itâ€™s in private beta and you should sign up <a href="https://interplayapp.com/#signup">here</a> ðŸ™Œ</p>

<p>I am also a visting lecturer in <a href="http://www.iadt.ie/courses/visual-communication-design">Visual Communication Design at IADT</a> where I teach designers to code. I believe a practical understanding of code is a crucial part of design education. It empowers designers to build and prototype things themselves and on larger projects it gives them the skills to collaborate more effectively with developers.</p>

<p>Recent projects include a new interface and design system for <a href="http://ti.to">ti.to</a>, product and brand design for <a href="http://backplane.io">Backplane</a>, a suite of sites for the <a href="http://joe.ie">joe.ie</a> family and a new site for <a href="http://terrydesign.co.uk">Terry Design</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to going freelance, I was lead designer on the Creative Technology team at <a href="http://onecore.ie/creative">Radical</a> (Now Core Creative) where I worked on a wide range of digital projects for clients including Toyota, Samsung, Mars, An Post and the Road Safety Authority of Ireland.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m at my best, and happiest, when Iâ€™m making products that are not only useful and beautiful, but that contribute towards making both the web and our world a better place.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not currently available for new projects but you can still <a href="mailto:hi@petermcdonagh.com?Subject=Hi">say hi on email</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/petermcdonagh_">find me on twitter</a>.</p>
