Hi, I’m a freelance designer and developer. I partner and collaborate with people, organisations and companies to help them plan, design and ship great products that are simple and easy to use. 

As a classically trained graphic designer who writes code, I straddle the full spectrum of design (well, except books — I haven't made a book since college). There are all sorts of ridiculous names for us — hybrid, devigner, unicorn

On smaller projects I work from brand and visual design and right through to front end development. These are usually new projects and startups at an early stage. On bigger projects, I'll be most useful to you bridging the gap between design and development — designing things that can be built efficiently and helping to ensure that nothing gets lost in translation. 

 Recently, I’ve been working on a new interface for [ti.to](http://ti.tio), a wonderful Irish company who make ticketing and event software. Last year I designed and built a new website for [3fe.com](http://3fe.com) which resulted in a 10x (1000%) increase in online sales in less than a year. I'm currently lead designer for a startup in San Francisco, overseeing the whole spectrum of design from brand and t-shirts to UI style guides and CSS.

Previously I was lead designer on the Creative Technology team at Radical where I worked on a wide range of digital projects for clients including Toyota, Samsung, Mars, An Post and the Road Safety Authority of Ireland.

I'm at my best, and happiest, when I'm making products that are not only useful and beautiful (that's a given), but which also contribute towards making both the web and our world a better place. 

If you’ve got a project you’d like to discuss drop me a message to [hi@petermcdonagh.com](mailto:hi@petermcdonagh.com), or say hi on twitter [@petermcdonagh_](http://twitter.com/petermcdonagh_).
