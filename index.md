Iâ€™m a freelance product designer from Northern Ireland. I partner and collaborate with people, organisations and companies to help them plan, design and ship great products that are simple, beautiful and easy to use. 

At the moment, I'm working with [Interplay](https://interplayapp.com) to build a new design tool that lets designers use code components from their design system to design visually in the browser or in their existing design tools. If you're working on design systems I'd love to show you what we're building so [drop me a message on twitter]((https://twitter.com/petermcdonagh_).) or [drop me an email](mailto:hi@pete.studio?Subject=Interplay)

I am also a visiting lecturer in [Visual Communication Design at IADT](http://www.iadt.ie/courses/visual-communication-design) where I teach designers to code. I believe a practical understanding of code is a crucial part of design education. It empowers designers to build and prototype things themselves and on larger projects it gives them the skills to collaborate more effectively with developers.

I'm at my best, and happiest, when I'm making products that are not only useful and beautiful, but that contribute towards making both the web and our world a better place.

I'm not currently available for new projects but please [say hi on email](mailto:hi@pete.studio?Subject=Hi) or [find me on twitter](https://twitter.com/petermcdonagh_).
