Hi, I’m a freelance designer and developer. I partner and collaborate with people, organisations and companies to help them plan, design and ship great products that are simple and easy to use. 

As a classically trained graphic designer who writes code there are all sorts of ridiculous names for people like me — hybrid, devigner, unicorn. But really, I'm at my most useful when I'm bridging the gap between design and development — designing things that can be built efficiently and ensuring that nothing gets lost in translation between design and development. 

 Recently, I’ve been working on a new interface and living style guide for [ti.to](http://ti.tio), an Irish company who make ticketing and event software. I designed and built a new website for [3fe.com](http://3fe.com), a Dublin cafe that's as famous around the world as it is in Dublin. And I'm currently acting as lead designer for a startup in San Francisco who are building a new cloud routing service for developers.

Previously I was lead designer on the Creative Technology team at Radical where I worked on a wide range of digital projects for clients including Toyota, Samsung, Mars, An Post and the Road Safety Authority of Ireland.

I'm at my best, and happiest, when I'm making products that are not only useful and beautiful, but that contribute towards making both the web and our world a better place. 

If you’ve got a project you’d like to discuss drop me a message to [hi@petermcdonagh.com](mailto:hi@petermcdonagh.com), or say hi on twitter [@petermcdonagh_](http://twitter.com/petermcdonagh_).
