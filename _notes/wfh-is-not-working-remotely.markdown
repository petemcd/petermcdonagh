Working from home is not remote work. During the pandemic we’ve experienced a rapid move to remote working as we can’t be in offices together. But this isn’t the same as remote working. Remote working means going to a cafe for the morning for a change of scenery, spending a day working with your friend in their company office, hit desking at a coworking space or having your own desk in a shared space. Or visiting new places for an extended time and working while you are there. It means meeting friends for lunch, travelling to work by bike, car, bus, train or on foot. All of these things break up the drudgery of working from home.

My 3 year old often needs some snuggles during the night so end up bringing her into the guest bedroom which is also my office. Working and sleeping in the same room is one of the worst things you can do for your mental health. Though as a student that’s what we did (though I think there’s a difference between working for an employer and the demands and responsibility that comes with that vs ca studying for yourself). 

As this starts to feel like the new normal we considered converting our attic and putting an office room in the garden. But then we remember that this kind of remote working isn’t going to last. 

I’ve talked to friends who are finding it tough and they say, you used to do this all the time, so this is probably normal. And I say, it’s not, working from home during a pandemic when you can’t see your friends or family is not remote working. 

One of the best things about remote working is that it gives you flexibility with your time so that you can spend it with family, friends or on hobbies. In fact, it’s critical to schedule those things so that you don’t go crazy. And right now, we can’t do any of that.

The mental health side of working from home is do tough. Some of the things I’ve been doing are:
Scheduling coffee zooms with other designers every week or two to share ideas and just chat. I find these conversations give me perspective on my work and refresh and energise my creativity. 
Taking walks throughout the day. Our 10 month old usually naps in his buggy so I’ll take him for a short walk during the day. Sometimes it’s only for 10 minutes, other days I’ll walk for a bit longer. It’s a nice excuse to take him for a walk. Sitting all day is one of the worst things you can do for your health. As well, a lot of people find they have their best ideas when they’re walking, Morgan Housel is one of them and he talks about it on his blog.
