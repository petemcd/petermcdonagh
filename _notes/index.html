    <p>I have wanted to write in public for a long time. In fact, it has featured in my yearly goals since 2015, but each year it got squeezed out by <a href="http://pete.studio">work</a>, travelling, <a href="http://instagram.com/guinearow">renovating a house</a> or starting a family. But I’m here and I’m quietly making a start.</p>

<p>Why now? Over the last few months I’ve been inspired by the digital gardens created by <a href="https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-tiddlywiki">Anne-Laure Le Cunff</a>, <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden/">Maggie Appleton</a> and <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org">Andy Matuschak</a>. A digital garden encourages the idea of writing in the open, publishing less polished notes, and tending to them over time. And I like that idea a lot.</p>

<p>It’s a place for me to collect and refine ideas, work and learnings so that they become more useful over time rather than getting lost in a jumble of meeting notes, to-do lists, journal entries and fragments of ideas.</p>

<p>It’s also a sneaky way of tricking myself into creating more than I consume. Scrolling twitter and saving articles to Instapaper feels like I’m learning, but actually I’m not learning much at all. Because as Andy Matuschak says, <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8QSUyNdq3CMK79KSnCW7QTR1MPHEFi4Q2LY8">collecting material feels more useful than it usually is</a>.</p>

<p>So, here I am — 4 month old baby in my left arm, typing with my right hand, saying, “hello world” 👋</p>
