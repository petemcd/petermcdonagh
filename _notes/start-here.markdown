I've had an itch to write in public for a long time. In fact, it has featured in my yearly goals since 2015. Every year it got squeezed out by [work](http://pete.studio), travelling, [renovating a house](http://instagram.com/guinearow) or starting a family. But I'm here and I'm quietly making a start.

Why now? Over the last few months I've been inspired by the digital gardens created by [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-tiddlywiki), [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden/) and [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org). A digital garden encourages the idea of writing in the open, publishing less polished notes, and tending to them over time. And I like that idea a lot.

It feels like the modern web is cluttered with click-baity content marketing and 'thought leadership' that regurgitates and recycles the same worn out material. While on the opposite end of the spectrum, there are a handful of writers doing the hard work of helping us better understand our world through truly virtuosic writing. 

But I kind of donâ€™t aspire to being either. In fact, this little slice of the internet is primarily for me. Expect it to be honest and a bit rough around the edges. You might find it interesting. Or not.

It's a place for me to collect and refine ideas, work and learnings so that they become more useful over time rather than getting lost and forgotten in a thousand meetings notes, to-do lists, journal entries and fragments of ideas.

It's also a sneaky way to push myself to create more than I consume because it's waaay too easy to scroll Twitter and feel like you're learning stuff because [collecting material feels more useful than it usually is](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8QSUyNdq3CMK79KSnCW7QTR1MPHEFi4Q2LY8).

So, here I am â€” 4 month old baby in my left arm, typing with my right hand, saying, "hello world" ðŸ‘‹
