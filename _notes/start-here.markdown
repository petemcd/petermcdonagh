I've wanted to write in public for a long time. It has featured in my yearly goals since 2015. But each year it got squeezed out by [work](http://pete.studio), travelling, [renovating a house](http://instagram.com/guinearow) or starting a family. Anyway, I'm here and I'm quietly making a start.

Why now? Over the last few months I've been inspired by the digital gardens created by [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-tiddlywiki), [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden/) and [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org). A digital garden encourages the idea of writing in the open, publishing less polished notes, and tending to them over time. And I like that idea a lot.

It's a place for me to collect and refine ideas, work and learnings so that they become more useful over time rather than getting lost in a jumble of meeting notes, to-do lists, journal entries and fragments of ideas.

It's also a sneaky way of tricking myself into creating more than I consume. Scrolling twitter and saving articles to Instapaper feels like Iâ€™m learning, but actually Iâ€™m not learning much at all. Because as Andy Matuschak says, [collecting material feels more useful than it usually is](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8QSUyNdq3CMK79KSnCW7QTR1MPHEFi4Q2LY8).

So, here I am â€” 4 month old baby in my left arm, typing with my right hand, saying, "hello world" ðŸ‘‹
