I've had an itch to write in public for a long time. In fact, it has featured in my yearly goals since 2015. Every year it got squeezed out by [work](http://pete.studio), travelling, [renovating a house](http://instagram.com/guinearow) or starting a family. But I'm here and I'm quietly making a start.

Why now? Over the last few months I've been inspired by the digital gardens created by [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-tiddlywiki), [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden/) and [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org). A digital garden encourages the idea of writing in the open, publishing less polished notes, and tending to them over time. And I like that idea a lot.

It feels like the modern web is cluttered with click-baity content marketing and 'thought leadership' that regurgitates and recycles the same worn out material. While on the opposite end of the spectrum, there are a handful of writers doing the hard work of helping us understand our world better with truly virtuosic writing. 

I kind of donâ€™t aspire to being either. 

Expect this little slice of the internet to be honest and a bit rough around the edges. It is primarily for me but you might find it interesting. 

For me it's a place to collect and refine ideas, work and learnings so that they become more useful over time and don't drown in a thousand meetings notes, to-do lists, journal entries and fragments of ideas.

It's a way to push myself create more than I consume because [collecting material feels more useful than it usually is](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8QSUyNdq3CMK79KSnCW7QTR1MPHEFi4Q2LY8) and [writing forces sharper understanding](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8q1K5a8i95qARkpFwS45qqtQzM8th82TkeUg).

It's a place to collect 

So, here I am â€” 4 month old baby in my left arm, typing with my right hand, saying, "hello world" ðŸ‘‹
