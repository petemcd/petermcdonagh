I've had an itch to write in public for a long time. In fact, it has featured in my yearly goals since 2015. Every year it got squeezed out by [work](http://pete.studio), travelling, [renovating a house](http://instagram.com/guinearow) or starting a family. But I'm here and I'm quietly making a start.

Why now? Over the last few months I've been inspired by the digital gardens created by [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-tiddlywiki), [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden/) and [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org). A digital garden encourages the idea of writing in the open, publishing less polished notes, and tending to them over time. And I like that idea a lot.

The modern web seems to be dominated by two extremes â€” at one extreme it is cluttered with click-baity content marketing and 'thought leadership' that regurgitates and recycles the same worn out material. And on the opposite end of the spectrum, there are a (much smaller) number of virtuosic writers who truly are thought leaders (no inverted commas required) forging new ground and articulating what the rest of us can't quite put our finger on. 

I kind of donâ€™t aspire to being either. This little slice of the internet is primarily for me. 

It's a way push myself to create more than I consume because [collecting material feels more useful than it usually is](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8QSUyNdq3CMK79KSnCW7QTR1MPHEFi4Q2LY8) and [writing forces sharper understanding](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8q1K5a8i95qARkpFwS45qqtQzM8th82TkeUg).

Expect it to be honest and a bit rough around the edges as I write about the things I'm learning, doing and thinking. Hopefully improves over time as my learning develops and ideas gain clarity.

 so that they're not left to drown in a thousand meetings notes, to-do lists and journal entries and fragments of ideas. 

It's a way to push myself to distill my thoughts, learnings and ideas a bit further. 

So, here I am â€” 4 month old baby in my left arm,  typing with my right hand, saying, "hello world" ðŸ‘‹
