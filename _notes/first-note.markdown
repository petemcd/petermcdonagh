I've had an itch to start writing more for a long time. In fact, it has featured in my yearly goals since 2015. But every year it got squeezed out by work, travelling, renovating a house or starting a family. 

Recently I've been inspired by the idea of a digital garden, by people like Anne-Laure, Maggie Appleton and Andy Matuschak. A digital garden encourages the idea of publishing less polished notes, and tending to it over time. As well as Jonnie Hallmann and Frank Chimero who popularised the idea of designing in the open. 

So, here I am â€” 2 month old baby in my left arm,  typing with my right hand, saying hello world.

In order to get over the [fear of getting started](https://www.shuomi.me/blog/dont-wait-until-conditions-are-perfect-how-to-beat-fear), I have resurrected my old Siteleaf Jekyll blog (which I [started in 2016](https://github.com/peterjrr/peterjrr.github.io/commit/1456ca7491cd3b28109d0dfde2f9945e916c75db)) which does the job. I might move to something more modern later, but right now, the most important thing is to start writing. After all, a blog is for writing, and it shouldn't require too much investment in the tool itself.

Anyway, I have been working on designing a design tool for the past couple of years with [Interplay](http://interplayapp.com) and I have a lot of thoughts and ideas that I have never properly articulated. This blog is a place for me to explore ideas about the future of design tooling and design systems in the open. I'd love for you to join me, and chime in if anything resonates with you, or if you have your own ideas about what you'd like from a design tool.
